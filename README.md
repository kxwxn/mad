What is the problem you are tackling? *

The sports industry is heavily dependent on plastic for equipment, apparel, and accessories, primarily because of its low cost, versatility, and durability. While some biodegradable materials exist, they haven’t fully been adopted yet by the industry. As a result, there are currently no fully viable, sustainable alternatives available on the market. This is where we come in. Our innovative technology represents the future of this industry—offering a groundbreaking solution that reduces reliance on fossil fuels and addresses the environmental challenges posed by plastic. We are not just an option; we are shaping the path toward a more sustainable sports industry.

To understand the framework of this industry we would like to highlight:
	•	The global sports equipment market alone is valued at over $70 billion, with plastics accounting for a large share of materials used.
	•	The sports apparel market is projected to reach $231 billion by 2025, with plastic-based materials like polyester and nylon continuing to dominate the market.
	•	The growing need for lightweight materials in sports and recreation is driving the market's rapid expansion. 
The opportunity lies in mycelium’s potential to replace plastic in sports equipment and apparel. While mycelium has gained traction in industries like packaging and textiles, its use in durable sports products remains underexplored. Mycelium can offer a viable, sustainable alternative due to its ability to be molded into strong, lightweight, and biodegradable materials. Research shows that mycelium-based materials can match or even exceed the performance characteristics of plastics in terms of strength and durability, while being fully biodegradable within months.

All these factors have significantly contributed to the growth of the indoor and outdoor climbing industry. However, this growth equally brings with it challenges that seem to contradict the environmental values of the sport climbing community and its market: 
	•	Currently over 20 million holds are produced for indoor climbing each year globally. 
	•	The global climbing volumes and holds market is expected to double in size by 2030. 
	•	This rapid growth, the high demand, the use of nearly exclusively non-recyclable materials and the decrease of the life span of this equipment to only 12-18 months, are one of the biggest problems in the industry.

This untapped potential positions MAD at the forefront of a rapidly growing demand for sustainable sports products. With the sports industry already moving toward sustainability—69% of consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable sports products—we can scale mycelium-based solutions to revolutionize the industry starting from climbing and moving to other sectors such as cycling, skiing, and even fitness accessories. With the right investment, MAD can capitalize on this emerging trend and lead the way in creating eco-friendly, high-performance sports equipment.


Why is this the exact right time to tackle this problem? *

As our first Market entry to tackle this problem we are choosing climbing because of the rapid growth of the indoor and outdoor climbing industry. This exponential growth seems to contradict the environmental values of the sport climbing community and its market. Also the eagerness of this community to find a better solution for the environment sets an unprecedented opportunity to tackle plastic consumption.

	•	Currently over 20 million climbing holds are produced for indoor climbing each year globally. Mainly this equipment is produced with PU or PE.
	•	The global climbing volumes and holds market is expected to double in size by 2030 up to 305.3 Million $.
	•	This rapid growth, the high demand, the use of nearly exclusively non-recyclable materials and the decrease of the life span of this equipment to only 12-18 months, are one of the biggest problems in the industry
	•	The Anti-Waste Law for a Circular Economy (AGEC) effective in Januray 2022, are pushing manufacturers to adopt more sustainable practices.

Building on this momentum, we presented our mycelium-based material at the Vertical Pro 2024 climbing fair in Friedrichshafen this November. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with three major climbing hold brands—Flatholds, Cheeta, and Blocz—approaching us to know more about this new material. These brands expressed strong interest in transitioning their products from non-recyclable plastics to fully biodegradable material. We are now actively engaged in discussions with them, exploring ways to integrate our technology and lead the industry into a more sustainable future.

Describe your solution *

We address plastic waste in the climbing industry with our project MAD providing sustainable climbing equipment made from mycelium, a biodegradable material derived from fungi. We have chosen mycelium to develop our climbing holds due to its remarkable properties and potential:
	•	Mycelium, the fungus root structure, offers a compelling combination of 100% biodegradability, recyclability.
	•	 Also a substantial reduction in weight—up to 50% lighter than traditional climbing holds. 
The decision to manufacture mycelium-based climbing holds as our market entry project is grounded in a combination of:
	•	ecological considerations
	•	technical feasibility
	•	support and access of mycologist experts
	•	deep connection to the climbing community. 

TRL LO QUE HEMOS HECHO HASTA AHORA 
	•	Empezamos Noviembre el año pasado creciendo los prototipos en el baño
	•	Luego MotionLab
	•	
The positive impact on environment and climate of our solution are multiple:
	•	Reduction of plastic consumption by 80%; We reduce it by replacing conventional plastic materials with mycelium, we can drastically reduce the amount of non-biodegradable waste generated by the climbing industry. 
	•	Significantly Lower carbon footprint by 30%; The production of mycelium requires less energy and emits fewer greenhouse gases compared to traditional plastic manufacturing.
	•	Lightweight advantage by 50%; Mycelium-based climbing holds are significantly lighter than their plastic counterparts, reducing their weight by more than half. This reduction enables better handling of the equipment for the route setters.

To identify and further elaborate the various facets of the problem we interviewed more than 60 industry experts and related stakeholders, 4 of them climbing gym owners of  which 2 of them have already agreed to be pilot testing partners for our different prototype products:
	•	Boulder Klub Kreuzberg (BK); Rob Ramirez as owner
	•	Der Kegel; Sven Schöder, Rob Ramirez, Erik Stöpel and Christian Wahle as owners. 
 Additionally we have built solid relations with members of IFSC (International International Federation of Sport Climbing) and DAV ( Deutscher Alpenverein, the national climbing association of Germany) committed to support us:
	•	Colin Knowles, the past Secretary-General of the ECC of the IFSC and currently a member of the Council's Sustainability Commission, engaged to improve sustainability in the operation of competition climbing.
	•	Marc Stannartz, in charge of nature & environment issues at the German Alpine Club Munich (DAV).

MAD primarily targets climbing hold brands, climbing gym owners, climbing institutions and individual climbing enthusiasts, initially in Germany before expansion to Europe and all over the world. Only in Berlin there are 28 gyms, 514 in Germany and +2000 in the EU and USA. An average gym in Germany spends around 60k€ in holds p.a. to attract new customers and keep up with the trends and quality. Given the passion of most climbers about nature, there is a strong appetite and support for our vision to revolutionize the climbing industry with renewable materials and circularity.


What are some of the potential negative consequences of your solution? *

Higher Production Costs: Using sustainable materials and processes could be more expensive than traditional methods at the beginning. This might make our product a bit pricier to manufacture for our climbing hold brands customers, which could be a barrier for some. We're working on finding ways to keep costs manageable while showing the long-term benefits of going green.
Adoption Hesitation: Some climbing hold brands might be hesitant to switch to a new technology. That’s why we are currently in contact with several brands that already came to us showing interest to push further this material and establish the first user cases to iterate from there and show to the industry the possibilities.
Logistical Challenges: Setting up a mycelium lab for mycelium-based materials production could lead to some infrastructure challenges and supply chain. We are looking at ways to streamline these processes and partner with local suppliers to keep things efficient.
Scalability: Our solution has had a good acceptance in the German market and we have received interest from the American market. To bring it global and adapt to different regulations from other countries we are starting small with the European market, learning from our early prototypes and building strong partnerships to adapt as we grow. With the possibility of setting up different production labs in other countries.

Describe the impact you want to make *

We aim to revolutionize the sports industry by providing a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics, addressing the environmental damage caused by the 400 million metric tons of plastic produced globally each year, of which less than 9% is recycled. In the climbing industry alone, over 20 million climbing holds are produced annually from non-recyclable materials like PU and PE, contributing significantly to landfill waste.
By introducing our mycelium-based materials, we have the potential to reduce plastic waste in this market while also decreasing carbon emissions. For example, transitioning just 50% of the climbing holds market to biodegradable materials could eliminate thousands of tons of plastic waste annually and cut lifecycle emissions by up to 60%.
Our vision is to lead a shift toward a fully circular economy within the sports industry, inspiring manufacturers and consumers alike to embrace sustainability. With the global climbing holds market expected to double to $305.3 million by 2030, our impact could extend far beyond the climbing industry, setting a precedent for sustainable practices in other sectors as well.


How do you measure your impact (or plan to)? * (to be updated)

	•	Decarbonization: Our products have a direct impact in reducing Co2 emissions through the use of recyclable materials. Our partner gyms Boulderklub Kreuzberg and der Kegel have around 2100 plastic holds each, with at least 300 being replaced yearly. Our goal is to substitute these within our first year, contributing to the reduction of Co2 emissions during production, consumption and transportation.

	•	Waste management: At the end of their lifespan, our climbing holds are either recycled or biodegraded. Emissions during this phase are significantly minimized, with a reduction of at least half compared to traditional plastic climbing holds, which are normally incinerated.

	•	Responsible Consumption and Production: We propose a sustainable production process by replacing traditional raw materials such as PU and PE with bio-based and recyclable alternatives for our holds. Additionally, we choose 3D printed PLA molds over conventional silicone molds. This dramatically reduces resource consumption, aligning with our commitment to environmentally conscious manufacturing

	•	Material Research: We focus on the exploration and testing of bio-based and recyclable materials. In a world with growing environmental consciousness and governments setting Net Zero targets, our initiative aligns seamlessly with these global sustainability goals. The growing market demand for eco-friendly materials, driven by environmentally aware consumers, positions our project strategically. We not only stay ahead of market trends but also differentiate ourselves in a competitive landscape, while contributing to a greener future.

	•	Product Development: Our focus on Product Development revolves around the development and testing of prototypes. In a dynamic market, maintaining innovation is crucial. Our commitment to produce a significant number of prototypes reflects our commitment boundaries and ensures the continuous improvement of our products. This is essential in order to meet the needs of our customers and stay competitive in the market.

What and when is your next big milestone? *

Our next big milestone is to establish partnerships with major climbing hold manufacturers by mid-2025, including Flatholds, Cheeta, and Blocz, to further develop our technology and launch the first generation of fully biodegradable climbing holds using our mycelium-based material.

This milestone involves completing material testing to ensure our products meet the industry's high-performance standards, setting up the up production processes and initiating pilot manufacturing runs with our partners. By XXX  of 2026, we aim to have few costumers
our products on the market, marking a major step in reducing plastic reliance and setting a new sustainability standard in the climbing industry.


What would be the biggest help for your company right now? *

To take our innovation to the next level, we are seeking investment to
refine our production process and enhance the performance of our material formula.

MAD is the first mycelium company oriented to design sustainable producst; it is a forward-thinking alternative company at the intersection of product design and exploration of bio-based and recyclable materials. Mycelium marks the beginning of our journey, where design and science merge to redefine industry standards.

At MAD we are pioneering the development of sustainable climbing holds made
from mycelium composite materials. Mycelium, the root-like structure of fungi, acts
as a binder when combined with organic substrates and allows us to create a
strong, durable and lightweight material. This renewable and biodegradable material
aligns with the climbing community’s growing emphasis on eco-friendly practices.

Our initial proof of concept has demonstrated the feasibility of producing functional,
visually appealing climbing holds with promising mechanical properties.
The funds we are requesting will enable us to optimize the mycelium recipe for
improved durability, consistency, and scalability while conducting rigorous testing to
ensure our product meets industry standards.

Mad envisions a future where the materials used in the sports industry are renewable and recyclable. After establishing the company as climbing hold producer and securing our product in the market we will explore further equipment that can be developed and manufactured with bio-based materials, keeping on reducing the impact of the plastic materials used for their development.

With the knowledge gained during the development of pour first product we will be able to develop tailor-made products with the specifications required to apply them to other user cases.
We thrive on the symbiotic relationship between design and scientific exploration. The goal is to have a team of designers and scientists working together on experiments and research, aiming to redefine industry practices. We are not confined by the boundaries of a single market; rather, it serves as a dynamic hub for continuous exploration and evolution.

Any other notes or remarks you want to share ( to be uptdated)

Our journey began with a major milestone: being selected for Bevisioneers, the Mercedes-Benz fellowship. We dreamt of revolutionising the climbing industry with sustainable materials and all of a sudden, we had the opportunity to do it, so we decided to get hands on work. We were so eager to prove our idea that we grew our very first prototypes with mycelium in our own bathroom. We didn’t have any other equipment or tools but we jumped into it!
These prototypes enabled us not only to test hypotheses and gather essential feedback but also to have a physical object that opened many doors:
	•	First step was Hardtech Innovation Accelerator program in Berlin where we were selected among other 150 projects. This accelerator allowed us to focus full-time on our idea for seven months. We validated our idea, continued prototyping, refined our pitch, and developed a proof of concept.
	•	With all this progress we secured a €23,000 scholarship grant from BeVisioneers in April. This funding was crucial for advancing our R&D allowing us to explore innovative solutions with our material.
	•	Our passion and convincing technology to combine high performance with sustainability led to signing two LOI’s with two local gyms in Berlin, BK and Der Kegel. These gyms provided direct feedback from end-users and space for testing.
	•	We gained support from major entities in the climbing scene, including the IFSC and DAV.
	•	We continued to win enthusiastic stakeholders at Vivatech fair in Paris with our own booth, winning the pitch competition at the German pavilion and also at HKW Berlin.
	•	In May, we secured second prize at the Hardtech Innovation Program, earning a €3,500 prize. These achievements added potential customers and investors that we are currently talking with.
	•	Next milestone; the invitation from EP to attend the finals of women’s in sport climbing at the Olympics in Paris 2024. This invitation from an industry partner aims to help us gather feedback and get exposure to world-class climbers as ambassadors for our product.
	•	On the 24th July, we launched the first prototypes of climbing holds made of mycelium. It was a success, the local community attended it and we gained valuable feedback and meaningful data to iterate.
	•	After that we displayed our prototypes to be tested by customers at Boulder Klub using a climbing competition as an event to present them to the public.
	•	On the 23rd of November an interview from the BBC was broadcasted 
	•	At the same time during that weekend we were attending one of the globally leading events of the climbing industry Halls and Walls at Friedrichshafen. We had a stand where we showed to the climbing industry the possibilities of this material, getting a high positive 
	•	Looking ahead, this event is preparing us for one of the globally leading events of the climbing industry Halls and Walls at Friedrichshafen. We have been invited by our supporters IFSC and DAV to be part of the “future wall”. This space will be dedicated to innovative designs and materials allowing visitors to experience our product, engage with industry stakeholders, and present our vision of the future of the climbing industry.

In summary, our project has made remarkable achievements, marked by successful prototypes, strategic partnerships, industry recognition, and significant financial support. 
We feel extremely happy to have created such a supportive community that believes in us, supports us and wants to see us succeed with this vision.
